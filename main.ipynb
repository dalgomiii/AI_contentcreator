      "\n",
      "🔍 What is Fermat's Last Theorem? 🤔\n",
      "Fermat's Last Theorem states that there are no three positive integers a, b, and c that satisfy the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for any integer value of n greater than 2. In simpler terms, there are no whole number solutions to the equation a^n + b^n = c^n if n is a whole number greater than 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔬 Why is this important? 🌟\n",
      "Pierre de Fermat, a French mathematician, first wrote about this theorem in the margin of his copy of an ancient Greek text in 1637. For over 350 years, mathematicians tried and failed to prove this seemingly simple statement. It wasn't until Andrew Wiles, a British mathematician, provided a proof using advanced mathematical techniques involving elliptic curves and modular forms that the theorem was finally confirmed.\n",

      "🔍 What is Graph Theory?\n",
      "Graph Theory is a branch of Mathematics that deals with studying graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. These objects are represented as vertices (often called nodes) connected by edges (lines).\n",

      "👩‍🔬 Who contributed to Graph Theory?\n",
      "One of the pioneers in Graph Theory is Leonhard Euler, a Swiss mathematician who lived in the 18th century. In 1736, he solved the famous Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem, laying the foundations of Graph Theory with his paper \"Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis\" (The solution of a problem relating to the geometry of position).\n",
